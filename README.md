# Calculator
A calculator I made with Python  
  
The calculator can add, subtract, multiply, and divide and i'm planning on adding more features in the future.  
If your expression is greater than the calculator is bigger than the display screen the calulator adapts the expression to fit the screen and you can navigate through your expression using arrow keys.  
  
You can use the calculator exclusively with the keyboard.
